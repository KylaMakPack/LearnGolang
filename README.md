Practice CLI Application to learn Golang

Write a simple application for Users to Book tickets

To Do:
1. Greet users when they visit the application, include information to users
2. Variables: Conference name, tickets
3. Operation on remaining tickets.
4. Ask user for information (first name, last name, email, amount og tickets they're booking)
5. Update ticckets remaining from number of tickets bought by user.
6. Save all users in an array.
7. Problem with CLI Application because can only book one person then the applciation exits, Use a loop so the app doesnt exit and can have multiple bookings. Ctrl+C to exit app
8. Loop through user first names of who has booked tickets.
9. When all tickets sold end application and tickets sold out.
10. Handle invalid input, check if they buy more than the remaining tickets.
